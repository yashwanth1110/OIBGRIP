        <p style="font-family:Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif">Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, who was also
             known as Mahatma, "Great Soul" Gandhi, was a hero, as well as a political and spiritual leader of India. He was of 
             the Hindu faith, of which I am too. Mohandas brought India to independence by using non-violent resistance. He 
             thought that there was injustice being served to the Indians, especially to the immigrants by the South Africans. 
             Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869 in Porbandar, Kathiawar, now known as Gujarat. Gandhi passed away at the age of 
             78 on January 30, 1948. Mahatma Gandhi was brought up in India near Rajkot, where he did most of his studies. 
             In 1888, Gandhi went to London, leaving his wife and son behind, to pursue his degree in law. Later in 1893, Gandhi
              went to South Africa to work and found that there was a lot of prejudice towards Indians. That was the reason Gandhi
               began protesting and eventually he became an inspiring hero for millions. The three main qualities that define 
               Gandhi as a hero are his strong leadership, simplicity and bravery.
            Leadership was one of Gandhi's heroic qualities. One way he demonstrated leadership was by encouraging people in his 
            village to start using homespun clothing. Homespun was one of Gandhi’s favorite hobbies. Introducing homespun to his 
            village promised the growth of the village’s economy. The poor became employed to make homespun clothes for others in 
            the village and outside of their own village. This drastically diminished the poverty in Gandhi’s village. Moreover, 
            Gandhi ended the issue of discrimination against untouchables. Back in those days, the Hindus used to discriminate 
            against the untouchables, who were their own kind but just low in the caste system. The untouchables are just another 
            word to describe poor, less educated people who really didn’t fit in with the middle class people. Gandhi made the 
            Hindus realize that what British people were doing to them is the same thing that they were doing to the untouchables. 
            This made the Hindus realize what they were doing to the untouchables. Last but not least, the Indian Independence 
            Movement was the all-time heroic deed led by Gandhi. This movement was accomplished in 1947 by Mahatma. This movement 
            took place because India was governed by the British, and Gandhi wanted India to become independent. Therefore, Gandhi 
            showcased many outstanding leadership skills that made him a hero.
